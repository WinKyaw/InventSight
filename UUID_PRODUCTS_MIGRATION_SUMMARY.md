# UUID Migration for Products Table - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This implementation addresses the mismatch between the Java entities (which use UUID primary keys) and the database schema (which was using BIGINT primary keys for products table). This was causing runtime errors due to type incompatibility.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Updates

**Updated `src/main/resources/schema.sql`:**
- Changed `products` table to use `UUID PRIMARY KEY` instead of `BIGINT`
- Updated all foreign key references to products (`sale_items.product_id`, `discount_audit_log.product_id`) to use UUID
- Ensured `stores` table uses UUID primary key (was already correct)
- Added proper foreign key constraints with UUID references
- Added comprehensive indexing for performance

**Created `src/main/resources/migration-uuid-fix.sql`:**
- Comprehensive migration script to handle transition from BIGINT to UUID
- Handles existing data preservation during migration
- Creates backup tables for safety
- Updates all foreign key relationships
- Removes redundant columns as specified in requirements
- Includes validation and error handling

### 2. Java Entity Validation

**Verified all entities use correct ID types:**
- ✅ `Product.java` - Uses UUID primary key (already correct)
- ✅ `Store.java` - Uses UUID primary key (already correct) 
- ✅ `SaleItem.java` - References Product via ManyToOne relationship (correct)
- ✅ `DiscountAuditLog.java` - References Product and Store via ManyToOne relationships (correct)
- ✅ `User.java` - Uses Long ID + separate UUID column for multi-tenancy (correct design)

**DTOs and Request/Response classes:**
- ✅ `ProductResponse.java` - Uses UUID (already correct)
- ✅ `SaleRequest.java` - Uses UUID for productId (already correct)
- ✅ All other DTOs properly handle UUID types

### 3. Test Coverage

**Created comprehensive test suites:**

**`ProductUuidMigrationTest.java`:**
- Validates Product and Store entities generate UUID primary keys
- Tests SaleItem properly references Product with UUID
- Tests DiscountAuditLog properly references Product and Store with UUID
- Validates business operations work correctly with UUID relationships
- Tests UUID format and uniqueness

**`ProductEntityValidationTest.java`:**
- Additional validation of entity relationships
- Business logic testing with UUID entities
- Comprehensive relationship testing

### 4. Migration Script Features

**`migration-uuid-fix.sql` includes:**
- ✅ Safe backup creation before migration
- ✅ Detection of current schema state
- ✅ Conditional execution based on current table structure
- ✅ Proper handling of foreign key constraints
- ✅ Data preservation during ID type conversion
- ✅ Cleanup of redundant columns (`uuid`, `store_id_uuid` columns)
- ✅ Index creation for performance
- ✅ Comprehensive validation
- ✅ Transaction safety with rollback capability
- ✅ Detailed logging for migration tracking

## Key Benefits

1. **Type Safety**: Eliminates runtime errors from BIGINT/UUID mismatch
2. **Data Integrity**: All relationships preserved during migration
3. **Performance**: Proper indexing on UUID columns
4. **Multi-tenancy**: Consistent UUID usage across all tenant-aware entities
5. **Future-proof**: Schema now matches Java entity expectations

## Validation

All changes have been validated through:
- ✅ Unit tests pass (ProductUuidMigrationTest, ProductEntityValidationTest)
- ✅ Entity relationship tests pass
- ✅ Business logic validation with UUID types
- ✅ Compilation successful with updated schema
- ✅ Migration script includes comprehensive validation

## Deployment Notes

1. **Migration Execution**: Run `migration-uuid-fix.sql` on target database
2. **Backup**: Script automatically creates backup tables before migration
3. **Rollback**: Backup tables allow rollback if needed
4. **Validation**: Migration includes built-in validation checks
5. **Monitoring**: Detailed logging for migration progress tracking

## Files Modified/Created

- **Updated**: `src/main/resources/schema.sql` - UUID-based schema
- **Created**: `src/main/resources/migration-uuid-fix.sql` - Migration script
- **Created**: `src/test/java/com/pos/inventsight/model/sql/ProductUuidMigrationTest.java`
- **Created**: `src/test/java/com/pos/inventsight/model/sql/ProductEntityValidationTest.java`
- **Created**: `src/test/resources/schema.sql` - H2-compatible test schema

## Requirements Addressed

- ✅ **Requirement 1**: Migrated products table to UUID primary key
- ✅ **Requirement 2**: Removed old bigint id column from products
- ✅ **Requirement 3**: Updated Java code to use UUID (was already correct)
- ✅ **Requirement 4**: Ensured store_id references use UUID
- ✅ **Requirement 5**: Removed redundant columns (uuid, store_id_uuid)
- ✅ **Requirement 6**: Updated migration scripts and documentation
- ✅ **Requirement 7**: Tested application builds and relationship preservation

This implementation provides a robust, safe migration path from BIGINT to UUID primary keys while preserving all data and relationships.
